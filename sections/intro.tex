\epigraph{\emph{To Oscar Zariski and Andr\'e Weil.}}

This memoir, and the many others that must follow, are intended
to form a treatise on the foundations of algebraic geometry. They do not assume,
in principle, any particular knowledge of this discipline, and it has even been
that such knowledge, despite its obvious advantages, could sometimes (by the
too-exclusive habit that the birational point of view it implies) to be harmful 
to the one who wants to become familiar with the point of view and techniques presented here. However, we assume that the reader has a good knowledge of the following topics:
\LS
\item \emph{Commutative algebra}, as it is exhibited for example in volumes
under preparation of the \emph{Elements} of N. Bourbaki (and, pending the
publication of these volumes, in Samuel-Zariski [13] and Samuel [11], [12]).
\item \emph{Homological algebra}, for which we refer to Cartan-Eilenberg [2]
(cited as (M)) and Godement [4] (cited as (G)), as well as the recent article by
A. Grothendieck [6] (cited as (T)).
\item \emph{Sheaf Theory}, where our main references will be (G) and (T); this
theory provides the essential language for interpreting in ``geometric'' terms
the essential notions of commutative algebra, and to ``globalize'' them.
\item Finally, it will be useful for the reader to have some familiarity with
\emph{functorial language}, which will be constantly used in this Treatise, and
for which the reader may consult (M), (G) and especially (T); the principles of
this language and the main results of the general theory of functors will be
described in more detail in a book currently in preparation by the authors of
this Treatise.

It is not the place, in this Introduction, to give a more or less summarily
description from the point of view of ``schemes'' in algebraic geometry, nor the
long list of reasons which made its adoption necessary, and in particular the
systematic acceptance of nilpotent elements in the local rings of ``manifolds''
that we consider (which necessarily shifts the idea of rational mappings into
the background, in favor of those of regular mappings or ``morphisms''). This
Treatise aims precisely to systematically develop the language of schemes, and
will demonstrate, we hope, its necessity. Although it would be easy to do so, we
will not try to give here an ``intuitive'' introduction to the notions
developed in Chapter 1. For the reader who would like to have a glimpse of the
preliminary study of the subject matter of this Treatise, we refer them to the
conference by A. Grothendieck at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 
Edinburgh in 1958 [7], and the expose [8] of the same author. The work [14]
(cited as (FAC)) of J.-P. Serre can also be considered as an intermediary exposition between the classical point of view and the point of view of schemes
in algebraic geometry, and, as such, its reading may be an excellent preparation
to that of our \emph{Elements}.

To finish, we believe it useful to warn the reader that, come all the authors themselves, they will undoubtedly have difficulty before becoming accustomed to the language of schemes, and to convince themselves that the usual constructions that suggest geometric intuition can be translated, in essentially only one sensible way, to this language.
As in many parts of modern mathematics, the first intuition seems further and further away, in appearance, from the correct language needed to express the mathematics in question with complete precision and the desired level of generality.

The references are given following the numerical system; for example, in III,~4.9.3, the III indicates the chapter, the 4 the paragraph, the 9 the section of the paragraph.
If we reference a chapter from within itself then we omit the chapter number.
